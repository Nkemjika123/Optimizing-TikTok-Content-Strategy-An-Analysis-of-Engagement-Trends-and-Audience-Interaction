Posts restricted to specific locations, such as **Nigeria**, **perform better** compared to unrestricted posts.  



## TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

### 9. How has engagement (likes) changed over time?  
![Screenshot 2025-02-10 230009](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14d433bb-7dfb-4ef2-8279-b9024838ec96)

The line chart shows a **significant increase** in engagement during **December to January 2025**, with total likes exceeding **10,000**.  

- Likes decline in **February 2025**, which may be due to the data being extracted on **07/02/2025**, resulting in incomplete February data.  
- During **November to December**, there was an **increase in posts (1–3 per day)**. In January, posting frequency decreased to **1–2 posts per day**.  
- The **spike in January 2025** suggests that consistent posting efforts during the preceding months led to the increase in engagement.

## CORRELATIVE ANALYSIS 

### 10. Is there a relationship between posting time (Date/Time) and engagement? 
![Screenshot 2025-02-10 215408](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f90e3ef-c3e5-406e-9ae4-4f19564d3deb)

The chart above highlights that the **7 PM to 10 PM** time slot is the most preferred, with an average of **over 3,000 likes** during these hours.

### 11. Which content settings (allowing stitches, duets, sharing to story) correlate with higher likes?  
![Screenshot 2025-02-10 215615](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/632c26d2-1323-4517-b6cf-6328407c3d04)

The correlation matrix reveals the following:  

1. **Like(s) and Allow comments_Yes (-0.53)**:  
   Moderate negative correlation. This suggests that allowing comments is associated with a slight decrease in likes.  
   
2. **Like(s) and Allow stitches_Yes (0.44)**:  
   Moderate positive correlation, indicating that allowing stitches is somewhat associated with an increase in likes.  

3. **Like(s) and Allow duets_Yes (0.07)**:  
   Weak positive correlation. There’s little to no relationship between allowing duets and the number of likes.  

4. **Like(s) and Allow stickers_Yes (0.19)**:  
   Weak positive correlation, indicating a slight increase in likes when stickers are allowed.  

5. **Like(s) and Allow sharing to story_Yes (-0.78)**:  
   Strong negative correlation. Allowing sharing to stories correlates with a significant decrease in likes.  


## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Leverage Trending Sounds**: Since trending sounds are encouraged, incorporate them into content to boost engagement and align with current platform trends.

2. **Focus on Educational Content**: Given the preference for educational content, consider creating more informative videos that provide value to the audience, potentially increasing reach and engagement.

3. **Optimize Posting Schedule**: With the peak engagement hours identified as 7 PM to 10 PM, schedule posts during this window to maximize likes and interactions.

4. **Utilize Location Restrictions**: Since posts restricted to specific locations perform better, tailor the content to target specific geographic audiences, enhancing relevance and engagement.

5. **Balance Content Types**: Maintain a strong focus on video content, which constitutes over 70% of your posts, while also exploring creative ways to integrate photos, which make up 25%.

6. **Capitalize on Seasonal Trends**: The spike in likes from December to January suggests a seasonal trend. Plan campaigns around this period to capitalize on increased user activity.

7. **Adjust Posting Frequency**: The increase in posts during November to December contributed to higher engagement. Maintain a consistent posting frequency to sustain interest. if possible, post 2-3 times.

8. **Engagement Features**: Re-evaluate the use of engagement features. Allowing stitches shows a positive correlation with likes, so i encourage this feature. However, be cautious with allowing comments and sharing to stories, as they show negative correlations with likes.

By implementing these recommendations, content strategy can be refined to better engage my audience and enhance TikTok presence.

## CONCLUSION

TikTok is an app that rewards its users effectively, emphasizing authenticity over aesthetics. It's a game of numbers where frequent posting can lead to greater algorithmic favor. Remember, sharing valuable content will ensure you are valued in return.
